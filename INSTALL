Step-by-Step Installation Instructions

========================================================================
sendmail:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download sendmail:

 ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.13.7.tar.gz

Unpack the distribution:

 sh$ tar xvzf sendmail.8.13.7.tar.gz

Make any necessary local configuration modifications, and then ensure
that regular expressions have been enabled:

 (site.config.m4):

APPENDDEF(`confMAPDEF', `-DMAP_REGEX ')

This may not be necessary in more recent sendmail releases; it does
not appear to be necessary as of 8.13.7 at any rate, but was with 8.11.x.

Edit sendmail/conf.h to bump up the allowed number of rulesets from 100
to 128 (or as required). Note that the number below is double the number
of allowed rulesets (so a value of 200 == 100 rulesets). Change

#define MAXRWSETS   200     /* max # of sets of rewriting rules */
to 
#define MAXRWSETS   256     /* max # of sets of rewriting rules */

This avoids an error message in the event that you end up using the full
package, which may have more than 100 total rulesets. I'm working on
trimming the package's use of rulesets, but sendmail.org is also working
on adding new rulesets with every new release, so it's not always
avoidable. If you find that during setting up your .cf you've exceeded
the ruleset limit, you'll see an error like:

  Jun 20 18:40:26 habanero sendmail[25012]: NOQUEUE: SYSERR(root):
  /etc/mail/sendmail.cf: line 19206: AddDomain: too many named rulesets
  (100 max)

Either recompile sendmail, or, if you can't, start removing EL HACK()s
until you're under the requisite 100 rulesets. Start with the various
uncommon header checks, such as EL_Check_Header_XOriginalArrivalTime,
before disabling more powerful parts of the package.

Also bump up the MAXNAME value to 1024, to avoid errors related to sendmail
automatically discarding parts of an overlong header.

Follow the rest of the instructions for building sendmail.

Once the binary has been created, we'll need to look into creating a .cf
file. This means we must first create a .mc file.

First, grab the latest package release:

 http://enemieslist.com/downloads/release.m4.tgz

   Please note that I'm working on a different release format, that will
   unpack into /usr/local/enemieslist.com and will feature "dist" files
   and be more flexible for occasional updates while allowing local
   overrides. Comments, suggestions welcome.

You may need to make a symlink from wherever your sendmail cf dir is
over to /etc/mail/cf (until we get things autoconfiscated).

Unpack the release tarball into your sendmail hack/ directory. Then
grab the latest version of the EL sendmail distro:

 http://enemieslist.com/downloads/sendmail_rules.m4

and stick it into your hack/ dir, too. You will also want to grab
the set of so-called "right anchors":

 http://enemieslist.com/downloads/sendmail_access_db

and add it to your access.db; it's all the access.db-compatible naming
schemes - the rest require regexes to work properly.

Please note that there is now another version of the "right anchors"
that is used to create a standalone db file, for tighter-grained control
over which addresses reject/tag mail from hosts that match those
substrings. Use either, as you prefer.

The sample .mc dropin is here:

 http://enemieslist.com/downloads/sample.mc

Add this to your .mc, making the appropriate changes to the defaults.
This includes making sure that the bit above "END dev-only local
configuration" is removed or disabled as appropriate for your install.

Then go to 'global options' and set the following macros:

define(`confEL_LOCAL_DOMAINS', `(example)\.(com|net|org)')dnl
define(`confEL_LOCAL_HOSTNAME', `mail\.example\.com')dnl
define(`confEL_LOCAL_IP', `10\.1\.1\.1')dnl
define(`confEL_LOCAL_IP_UNESCAPED', `10.1.1.1')dnl
define(`confEL_CONTACT_EMAIL', `postmaster@example.com')dnl
define(`confEL_CONTACT_PHONE', `+1-555-555-1212')dnl
define(`confEL_ROLE_ACCOUNTS', `(abuse|hostmaster|postmaster|webmaster)')dnl

define(`confEL_GEOGRAPHIC_ISOCODES',
       `(africa|AE|AR|BF|BG|BJ|BW|CI|CY|DK|ES|ET|GH|IL|IR|KE|KR|LB|LV|ML|MR|MY|NG|NL|RW|SN|TG|TH|VN|ZA|ZW)')dnl
define(`confEL_BogusInReplyToDomains',
       `(example.com|example.net|example.org)')dnl
define(`confEL_HeaderSuspicious', `X-EL-Suspicious')dnl

Read through the whole file and enable or disable any of the bits you
are particularly interested in or cannot use because of local policy.
If you have any questions about any of the switches, feel free to email
me at beta@enemieslist.com.

Pay close attention to the various DBM files you'll need to create; the
whitelist, policy, wordlist, blacklist, domains, offwhitelist, geographic,
badhelos, etc. You can grab some of these from the EL downloads site;
I recommend you start with geographic (for fighting 419 scams), wordlist
(for fighting off "Mobster I. Syphilitic" spamware), whitelist (for the
occasional legit but misconfigured mail server), and policy (for setting
the local default and any override policies).

Building the DBM files is relatively easy; we use a script here that
simply runs makemap on them a la:

echo "making blacklist..."
makemap -v btree $DIR/blacklist.db \
        < $ADIR/blacklist 2>&1 | grep "duplicate key"

where DIR is /etc/mail and ADIR is a temporary location where we
maintain our own local copies during the make.

Double check to make sure you're using the same type of map in the call
to makemap as you specified in the .mc file. For example, we use 'btree'
because it's proven fastest to rebuild, so in the .mc file make sure to
set confEL_DB_MAP_TYPE appropriately.

  define(`confEL_DB_MAP_TYPE', `btree -T<TMPF>')dnl

The starter policy file is here:

 http://enemieslist.com/downloads/sample-policy

Each SMTP-time error and header "tagging" error message is configurable
via .mc, as well - the defaults are inoffensive enough, but you can use
this as a template if you need to modify them; the tokens (e.g. GENRDNS)
should stay, though - they're keyed to the checks and can help me track
down which rule is giving you fits or not working properly, and you can
use them to generate stats:

 http://enemieslist.com/downloads/allerrordefines.m4

Building the .cf file from the .mc is simply a matter of running m4 on
your .mc file and capturing the output in a new .cf:

  m4 < your.mc > yournew.cf

To ensure you've done everything correctly, and created a working .cf
file, you'll want to test it with sendmail itself.

  sendmail -bt -C ./yournew.cf

You *should* get directly to the test mode prompt, a la

  ADDRESS TEST MODE (ruleset 3 NOT automatically invoked)
  Enter <ruleset> <address>
  > 

If you see any errors, and be sure to check your syslog as well, as some
errors don't show up in the console, walk back through and see if you can
tell where things broke. 

??? run series of other, check-specific tests (still packaging these up)

If everything looks good, make a backup of your current sendmail.cf, and
install the new .cf file where your sendmail looks for sendmail.cf. Restart
your server with a HUP signal or via init script, and start watching the
mail logs for rejected spam and abuse. 

I recommend you follow stats on your rejected email, on at least a daily
basis and possibly in real-time for the first few days, as you discover
which of the hosts you ordinarily communicate with fail basic RFC
compliance or act in suspicious ways, so you can contact those admins or
in the worst case, simply whitelist their servers locally.

And that's it! If you see mail get through that you think should be
filtered, and EL isn't doing the job, send examples to me via email and
I'll do what I can do. We especially welcome new "generic" reverse DNS
patterns, so we can expand the patterns database.
